## Summary of Findings

I have reviewed the code, the PR, and the GraphQL API. I have identified a major blocker: the GraphQL API at `https://kong.yearn.farm/api/gql` does not seem to provide the necessary strategy details (`performanceFee`, `managementFee`, `debtRatio`) for the APY calculation.

### Local Code:
*   The local code in `/Users/matheus/Desktop/yearn/fapy-hook` is a service for calculating APYs for Yearn vaults.
*   It has a server component with a `/webhook/fapy` endpoint.
*   The core logic is in the `fapy` module, which calculates APYs for Curve-like strategies.
*   The calculation requires detailed information for each strategy, including `performanceFee`, `managementFee`, and `debtRatio`.

### Pull Request #229:
*   The PR seems to be a refactoring and enhancement of the APY calculation logic.
*   The changes are concentrated in the `fapy` module.

### GraphQL API (`https://kong.yearn.farm/api/gql`):
*   I have successfully queried the API and retrieved a list of vaults and their strategies.
*   The `vaults` query returns a `strategies` field, but it's a list of addresses (strings), not objects with details.
*   There is a `strategies` query, but it only returns the `address` and `name` of the strategies, not the required details.
*   I have not found any other query that would provide the strategy details.

### Conclusion:
The local code is not compatible with the current GraphQL API schema, as it cannot fetch the required strategy details.
